Height and Weight Measurement Device with ESP32 DevKitC
This project is a height and weight measurement device using the ESP32 DevKitC board, ToF400 distance sensor, and load cells. The complete PCB design and mechanical structure were designed and developed by me.

*Technologies Used
-ESP32 DevKitC
-ToF400 Time-of-Flight Distance Sensor
-Load Cells
-C / Arduino Programming
-PCB Design
-Mechanical Design

*Setup
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/Height_Weight_Device.git
2.Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Arduino IDE or VS Code).
3.Compile and upload the firmware to the ESP32 DevKitC board.
4Assemble the device hardware according to the schematic and mechanical design.

*Usage
-Power the device and connect the sensors.
-The device measures height using the ToF400 sensor and weight using load cells.
-Readings can be viewed via serial monitor or a connected display (if implemented).

*Results
-Accurate height and weight measurements achieved.
-Device components fully integrated, including PCB and mechanical design.

*Future Improvements
-Add wireless data transmission (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi).
-Integrate a display for real-time readings.
-Implement calibration and error correction features.
